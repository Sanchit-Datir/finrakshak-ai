# Deploying

Deploys run from GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) with **no stored keys**: GitHub
proves its identity to Google through Workload Identity Federation.

| Event                     | What happens                                        | Runs as           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Pull request (same repo)  | Builds the web app, publishes a 7-day preview URL   | `github-preview`  |
| Push / merge to `main`    | Checks, builds, deploys Hosting + Functions + rules | `github-deployer` |
| Docs-only change (`*.md`) | Nothing is deployed                                 | -                 |

`github-preview` can only manage Hosting. `github-deployer` can only be used by runs on
`refs/heads/main`, so a pull-request branch can never deploy Functions or change Firestore rules.

## One-time setup (already done for `fund-tracer`)

```bash
scripts/setup-gcp.sh fund-tracer Sanchit-Datir/fund-tracer
```

It is safe to re-run. It creates the two service accounts, the identity pool locked to this repo,
and prints the values the workflow already uses as defaults. Nothing needs to be added to GitHub
secrets. Add the public web config as repo **variables** once the web app talks to Firebase
(`VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`).

## Changing what CI can do

Add the role to the right list in `scripts/setup-gcp.sh` and re-run it. Give previews as little as
possible; anything that changes production belongs to `github-deployer`.

## When a deploy fails

- **Permission denied on one API:** read the error, add that single role to `github-deployer`.
- **Bad release:** revert the merge commit on `main`; the same pipeline redeploys the old code.
  Hosting also keeps every version (Firebase console → Hosting → Release history → Rollback).
- **Cost:** deploys only run on merges to `main` and non-docs PRs. A Functions deploy uses Cloud
  Build (inside the free allowance) and leaves a container image; the cleanup policy removes old ones.
